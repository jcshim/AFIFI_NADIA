# New Topics
Hello Professor, 
I just received from my colleague a new topic:

Smart Fog Computing-based Smart Agriculture. 

Fog computing, edge Devices, and cloud computing together can provide an impressive amount of resources for ongoing industrial projects by improving the utilisation of existing edge resources. 

Best regards.
